# SystemVerilog Advanced Constructs: Arrays, OOP, Casting, Strings etc.,

This repository showcases practical implementations of advanced **SystemVerilog constructs**, with a strong emphasis on object-oriented programming (OOP), verification modeling, and dynamic simulation features. It includes usage of arrays, string manipulation, encapsulation, dynamic casting, and polymorphism â€“ all essential for UVM-based testbench design and real-world functional verification.
